        <p>Baharzada is my artist name that I publish all of my original artwork underneath. I was given the nickname by
            a good friend and it stuck. Currently, I am working for a startup company, Quiddity, in the creation and
            release of their NFT collection to be launched alongside their company</p>

        <p>I have been training in Martial Arts for 10 years. I began my journey in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu but have since
            moved on to MMA at my home gym of Indy Boxing and Grappling</p>
        <p>Here are some of my favorite moments through the years. So many amazing memories with plenty of time to make
            more</p>
        <br>
        <p>My first Jiu-Jitsu match against world class opposition. I lost, but learned I was capable of hanging with
            the best guys around</p>

        <br>
        <p>Being lead cornerman as my good friend and training partner secured his spot in the B2 Professional
            Welterweight Grand Prix by submitting a very game Chance Beck</p>
